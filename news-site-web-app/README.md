Creative Portion:
1. The first thing I did for the creative portion was add a genre feature to stories. This allowed me to classify various stories into common sections, which I then designed into different pages on my website. For example, stories that are about technology are present on the starting tab as well as the technology tab. This way, if a user of the website is only interested in technology stories, they can navigate to the technology tab.

2. The second thing I did was give the creator of a story the ability to delete any comment made under their story. This allows creators to remove hateful or unnecessary comments made on their stories. However, apart from the comments made on their own stories, users cannot delete the comments of others on other users' stories. I figured since other forms of social mediam have this option, it would be reasonable to add into this project. 

3. The third thing I added was the ability to upvote comments on stories. Any given user is allowed to upvote a comment on any given story. Once a user has updated a comment, they cannot upvote it again. If they have upvoted a comment, they can undo their upvote by downvoting it. Using the upvote value of comments, I made it so that comments under stories are filtered by descending upvote value and descending timestamp value. This way, the most popular and recent comments are at the top.
