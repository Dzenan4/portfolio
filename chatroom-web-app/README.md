CREATIVE PORTION:

For the creative portion, I added 3 things:

The ability to block users. Once a user is blocked, you do not see their
messages in the chat and you cannot receive private messages from them.

The ability for a room admin (the creator of the room) to clear the entire chat of
the room. This works by clearing the chatlog for all the users currently in the room

The ability for users to invite other users to a room by simply entering in the name
of the room. This works by sending a message to the person invited, notifying them
they have been invited to a room and are able to join through a simple button click
