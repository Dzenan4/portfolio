Login Details: 

- Valid usernames are DzenanZ4, MikePZ1, and Noahh123. DzenanZ4 contains a text file, pdf, and png image. 

For the creative portion:

- I added the ability to filter the outputted list of files in ascending or descending order. This decision can be made
by the user using a dropdown. 

- I added the ability to copy and rename files. Copying a file is as easy as clicking on the 'copy file' button next to 
the file to be copied. This results in a new file of the same name as the copied file with a '-1' at the end. 

- In order to rename a file, there is a rename button that, upon being clicked, displays a text input with 
two buttons: 'confirm' and 'cancel'. By typing a name in to this text input and clicking confirm, the file is 
successfully renamed. Clicking cancel simply removes the text input and its associated buttons from view.
